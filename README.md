A comprehensive data science project analyzing global uranium demand trends using **Thermal Capacity (MWt)** as a primary proxy. This project utilizes data from the **IAEA Power Reactor Information System (PRIS)** to build a robust data pipeline, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), forecast future demand using Facebook Prophet, and validate model performance.

## Project Overview

While most energy analysis focuses on *supply* (electricity generated), this project models the **demand side** (uranium consumption). By tracking the **Thermal Capacity** of the global reactor fleet, we can estimate fuel requirements independent of electrical conversion efficiency.

**Key Objectives:**
1.  **Data Engineering:** Transform raw, unformatted reactor database logs into clean, aggregated time-series data.
2.  **EDA:** Visualize historical trends, technology shifts, and the construction pipeline.
3.  **Forecasting:**
